This being a \nsecurity issue, i nformation security therefore plays a vital role in Internet transaction s. It can be deduced that  secure \ndigital communicati on is necessary  for many aspects relating to  web based  activities , e-commerce, and secured instant \nmessaging . More so for private, confidential, and vital information,  the reality that safe, secure communication between \nparties communicating over t he Inter net is now a necessity cannot be overstated.  Cryptography is an indispensable tool \nfor protecting information in computer systems. Today\u2019s cryptosystems are divided into two categories: symmetric and \nasymmetric. The difference lies in the keys used in decr yption and encryption \u2014symmetric cryptography uses the same \nkey for both of these processes,  whereas asymmetric cryptosystems use one key (the public key) to encrypt a message and \na different key ( the private key) to decrypt it.  The Diffie -Hellman key excha nge is one of the more well-known asymmetric \nalgorithm s, formulated by its namesakes Whit field Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. It is referred to in various ways, \ne.g. Diffie -Hellman protocol, Diffie -Hellman handshake, or Diffie -Hellman key negotiation, and commonly shortened to \nD\u2013H, or DH,  for convenience.  \n      Keywords: Cryptography, Diffie -Hellman , SSH, IP sec, SSL, Key Exchange  \nI. INTRODUCTION  \nFor information to be secure, one has to be prevent access to it from unauthorised users (the principle of \nconfidentiality ), prevent it from undergoing unwanted changes ( integrity ), and ensure that it is available to its \nintended users ( availability ). This can be guaranteed by means of protocols that make use of security primitives \nsuch as encryption, digital signa tures and hashing  [6]. \n The first researchers to formulate  and publish the concepts of public -key cryptography  (PKC)  were Whitfield \nDiffie and Martin Hellman , both  from Stanford University, in parallel with  Ralph Merkle , from the University \nof California a t Berkeley. Specifically, Diffie and Hellman worked on public key cryptography while  Merkle \nmade his contributions on public key distribution  [7]. When they became aware of each other's work they \ndecided to work together in hope for better result s. This la ter led to the publication of their joint paper , titled \n\"New Directions in Cryptography\u201d \u2014published in November 1976  [2]. This paper brought a new idea to the \nfield of cryptography ; it described the key concepts of public -key cryptography such as  the produc tion of digital \nsignatures, and gave some algorithms for implementation.  \nThe idea of public key cryptography was born as a  result of two major challenges.  The first  of these  was the \nproblem of key distribution:  if two people who have never met before are to communicate  using digital systems \nas a medium , using conventional cryptography would mean that  they must somehow agree on a common key \nthat will be known to themselves and no one else.  The other problem was the issue of signatures:  this is a \nmethod of providing  the recipient of a purely digital electronic message with a way of demonstrating to other \npeople that it had come from a particular person, serving as a signature comparable to a written one on a letter.  \n \nII.

Both of these are drawn \nfrom the set of integers {1, \u00bc, p - 2}. They will then combine these private values with p and g to derive their \nrespective public keys.  Alice's public value is x = g a mod p, while  Bob's is , of course,  y = g b mod p. \nTo proceed, the parties will send their public key to one another, in a pro cess of key exchange . Even though \nboth had kept their private values secret, Alice will compute  ka = y a mod p, and Bob computes kb = x b mod p. \nLaws of algebra dictate that ka = kb = k, and so, Alice and Bob now have a common secret key k. \nThe protocol de pends on the discrete logarithm problem for its security. It is relatively safe to assume that to \ncalculate the shared secret key k from  the known public values alone will prove to be computationally infeasible \nwhen the prime p is sufficiently large. As sh own by Maurer before, breaking the Diffie -Hellman exchange is, \nunder certain assumptions,  equivalent to computing discrete logarithms . In that sense, then, it is quite safe \u2014in \nthe real world of course it will be coupled with several other measures, but it would be good enough to be \nincluded among those measures.  \nUsing a table , one can summarise the process as follows:  \n \nTable 1: The Diffie -Hellman key exchange.  \nProcess  Parameters  \nAlice and Bob agree on two numbers : \np and g p is a large prime number  \ng is the  generator , or the base  \nAlice privately picks a secret number a Alice \u2019s secret number = a \nBob privately picks a secret number b Bob\u2019s secret number = b \nAlice computes her public key  \nx = g a mod p Alice \u2019s public number = x \nBob computes his public key \ny = g b mod p Bob\u2019s public number = y \nAlice and Bob exchange their public keys, to be used for \nprivate generations of a common secret key.

SSL is used by million s of websites in the protection of their online transactions with their \ncustomers  [9]. \nSSL is all about encryption. SSL uses certificates, private/public key exchange pairs and Diffie -Hellman key \nagreements to provide privacy (key exchange), authentication  and integrity with Message Authentication Code \n(MAC) . This information is known as a cipher suite and exists within a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) . \nSSL is useful for business/financial traffic, e.g. credit card transactions. SSL ensure s confidentiality  (it prevent s \neavesdropping), authenticity (the sender is really who he says he is), and integrity (the message has not been \nchanged en route ). It is possible that a user might not know SSL is used in the course of communication but they \nare likely to noti ce some blockages.  \nSSL/TLS is composed of two layers: the lower layer , called the record protocol , rides on TCP and manages the \nsymmetric (private) cryptography so the communication is private and reliable. The upper layer is called the \nhandshake protocol  and it is in this layer that D -H is used. The handshake allows the server to authenticate itself \nto the client using public -key techniques, also called asymmetric encryption. It also allows the client and the \nserver to cooperate in the creation of symmetr ic keys, which are used for rapid encryption and decryption. This \nimplies that while communication is in progress the client and server exchange unencrypted handshake \nmessages that include hellos and  then information about which encryption, key exchange, and compression \noptions they each accept and prefer  [8]. \nDuring the SSL handshake, each computer generates a set of codes to encrypt information. From these codes, \neach computer creates two keys, one private and one public. Your computer keeps the private key secret, but \nsends out the public key to the other computer, which uses that key to encode subsequent messages so that only \nyour computer can read them. The public key cannot, however, be used to decode the message; the decoding can \nonly be done using t he private key. These keys allow you and the other computer to lock and unlock information \nso that only the holder of the private key can read messages encrypted by the public key. Since only you and the \nother computer have a copy of your respective privat e keys, there is no way for anybody else to intercept and \ndecode your messages.

After this exchange, keys are computed and the \nparties begin encrypting all traffic between them, using the computed keys and agreed upon methods.  \nB. Secure Shell (SSH)  \nSSH is a network secu rity protocol very common for secure remote login on the Internet.  The secure shell has \ncome to replace the unsecured Telnet on the network and FTP on the system, mostly because b oth Telnet and \nFTP do not encrypt data , and instead send them  in plain text. SSH, on the other hand,  can automatically encrypt, \nauthenticate and compress transmitted data  [10].  \nThe key exchange protocol itself is a component of the SSH as a whole, particularly responsible for parties \nagreeing upon the keys used by the various prim itives later in the SSH protocol. [2] This is the first stage of the \nSSH algorithm, and it happens before the establishment of session keys.  \nThe protocol proceeds in three stages . The first of these is  the \u201c Hello \u201d phase , where the first identification is \ndone. A list of supported algorithms is involved here after the first \u201c Hi\u201d message, and this  list details the \nsupported Diffie -Hellman key groups, among other things . The second  stage sees the two parties  agree upon a \nshared secret key  x, which  is done by an implementation of a Diffie -Hellman exchange. At the final stage , the \nshared secret key, session identifier and digest are used to generate the application keys . [5] \nCurrently, the \" diffie -hellman -group1 -sha1 \" method  is practised in the key exchange,  prescribing  a fixed group \non which all operations are performed. The key exchange is  then signed with the host key to provide host \nauthentication.  \nC. IP Security (IPSec)  \nIPSec (IP Security) is an extension of the Internet Protocol (IP) \u2014it is a suite of protoco ls introduced by the \nInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  to aid in configuring a communications channel between multiple \nmachines. Operating at the IP layer of the seven -layer model, it does its job by authenticating and encrypting IP \npackets  [11]. \nLike the previous protocols, IPSec uses D -H and asymmetric cryptography to establish identities, preferred \nalgorithms, and a shared secret. Before IPSec can begin encrypting the data stream, some preliminary \ninformation exchange is necessary. This is accomplis hed with the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)  protocol. IKE \nuses DH to produce  a shared secret via the usual mechanisms, and then authenticate each other; after that, the \nsecret key is used for encryption purposes.  This shared secret key is never exchanged over  the insecure channel  \n[8]. \n \nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING STATEMENTS  \nThe Diffie -Hellman key exchange exploits mathematical properties to produce a common computational result \nbetween two (or more) parties wishing to exchange information, without any of them pr oviding all the necessary \nvariables. By agreeing on two variables and providing each other with a computed public key, the resulting \nsecret key will be identical throughout the exchange.  \nIt is, of course, possible to intervene by either masquerading or by sheer brute force, but the first is a common \nconcern \u2014 authentication \u2014 which must be addressed separately, and the second is, when done right, \ncomputationally infeasible (hence the alternative name \u201cexponential key exchange\u201d).  With proper authentication \nmechanisms, proper prime generation, and true randomness in picking variables, the D -H protocol can be a \npowerful component in many a security measure. Good implementations include usages in Secure Sockets \nLayer, Secure Shells, IP Security, and others.  \nPassages on short introductory and background information, description, issues, as well as common usages were \nproduced in this report, and it is hoped that they were all of sufficient clarity.  \n \nREFERENCES  \n[1] Burnett, S. and Paine, S.
